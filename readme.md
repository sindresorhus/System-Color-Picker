## Where is the source code?

The app is no longer open-source. Despite initial hopes for community collaboration, the project received no contributions while facing challenges with App Store clones. The effort required to maintain it as open-source outweighed the benefits.

Rest assured, the app remains actively developed. I will continue using GitHub issues for requests and bug reports.
